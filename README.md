# Terning
This program started out with multiple bugs.  
The program has now been tested in _Junit_ and the bugs have been fixed.  
The bugsfixes can be seen in the branch **BugFixes**  
The bugs are as follows:
* When a number has been input for the amount of rolls, the total amount of rolls is input - 1
    * This has been changed so that the correct amount of rolls is being output.
* 


## Purpose
This exercise had the purpose of testing _Junit_, _GitHub_ collaberation and _Markdown_ files.  
Additionally it had the purpose of fixing errors and tracing those changes.
